# Personalised-Image-Generation
This repository showcases a project leveraging advanced deep learning and digital image processing (DIP) techniques. It employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for realistic image generation and transformation. At its core, the project utilizes the pSp (pixel2style2pixel) model, built upon StyleGAN, for latent space encoding, allowing precise control over facial attributes such as age, smile, and hairstyle. Additionally, InterFaceGAN is integrated to manipulate specific features along predetermined directions within the latent space, enhancing targeted editing capabilities. GANSpace is used to conduct PCA-based exploration, enabling users to edit and experiment with various attributes of both facial images and objects seamlessly. This repository is an excellent resource for researchers, AI enthusiasts, and developers looking to explore cutting-edge techniques in generative models and image manipulation.
