# Personalised-Image-Generation
This project employs advanced deep learning techniques, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for realistic image generation and transformation. Using the pSp (pixel2style2pixel) model, based on StyleGAN, it performs latent space encoding to enable fine-grained control over attributes like age, smile, and hairstyle in facial images.
